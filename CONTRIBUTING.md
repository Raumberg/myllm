# Contributing to myllm

First of all: **thank you for even thinking about contributing!**
We want this project to be a playground for modern, clean, and robust LLM fine-tuning. If youâ€™re here to make things better, youâ€™re already awesome.

But letâ€™s be real: we value quality, clarity, and a bit of fun. If youâ€™re going to send a PR, please donâ€™t make us cry. Read this guide, and everyone will be happier (especially you).

## Philosophy
- **No bs.** Code should be clean, readable, and actually work.
- **Modern ML only.** We love new tech, but only if itâ€™s not cargo cult.
- **Reproducibility is king.** If your change breaks reproducibility, itâ€™s a no-go.
- **Donâ€™t be rude.** Be kind in issues, reviews, and discussions.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Fork & Branch
- Fork the repo and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
- Use clear branch names: `fix/fp8-logging`, `feat/quantization`, `docs/readme-update`.

### 2. Code Style
- **Python 3.12+** only.
- You can follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), but since we are in ML, it's hard to be codestyle-god sometimes.
- You can use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting (see `requirements-dev.txt`).
- Docstrings for all public functions/classes. Comments are good, but donâ€™t explain the obvious.
- Keep imports clean. Optional deps? Use the `myllm.utils` lazy importers.
- Don't be obsessed with `clean-code` bs. We need to understand things and be ready to change and research, not to follow abstract classes' childs.

### 3. Tests
- All new features and bugfixes **ideally** have tests. But.. we are in ML, remember that. Testing a GPU runs can be costly and time-consuming.
- Use `pytest`. Place tests in `tests/`.
- Run `pytest` before pushing. If itâ€™s red, donâ€™t even try a PR.

### 4. Commits & PRs
- Write clear, meaningful commit messages. No `fix stuff` or `update`.
- Squash trivial commits before PR (keep history clean).
- PRs should be focused: one feature/fix per PR. Donâ€™t mix unrelated changes.
- Reference related issues in your PR description.
- Add a summary of what/why/how in the PR. If itâ€™s a big change, explain your reasoning.

### 5. Local Development
- Clone, then run:
  ```sh
  uv pip install -e .
  make help
  ```
- Use `make` targets for common tasks (see `Makefile`).
- For dev dependencies: `uv pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
- Use a virtualenv or `uv venv`.

### 6. Issues & Feature Requests
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Bug reports: include logs, stack traces, and steps to reproduce.
- Feature requests: explain the use case, not just the feature.
- Be respectful. Weâ€™re all here to build cool stuff.

### 7. What NOT to Do
- Donâ€™t add heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
- Donâ€™t break existing APIs without discussion.
- Donâ€™t submit code you havenâ€™t run locally.
- Donâ€™t write code you wouldnâ€™t want to maintain yourself.

## FAQ / Common Pitfalls
- **CI fails on install?** Check your `pyproject.toml` and try `uv pip install -e .` locally.
- **Optional dependency import errors?** Use the lazy importers from `myllm.utils`.
- **Tests are slow?** Use smaller configs/datasets for testing.
- **Not sure if your idea fits?** Open an issue and ask!

## Contact & Feedback
- For questions, open an issue or start a discussion.
- For private stuff, email the maintainer (see `pyproject.toml`).
- If youâ€™re angry, take a walk, then write a polite message.

## Final Words
We love bold ideas, but we love working code even more. If you make our lives easier, weâ€™ll love you forever. If you break things, weâ€™ll find you (just kiddingâ€¦ or not).

Happy hacking! ðŸš€
